process CLASPAR {
    /*
	The process for running ClasPar.

        Inputs:
            - climb_id: Climb ID for a given sample
            - server: Where Onyx results should go i.e. synthscape or mscape.
            - outdir: (optional) Output dir - here given as . (work dir) and Nextflow will publish to params.outdir anyway.
            - profile_tables: path to excel spreadsheet which contains the taxa to profile mappings.
            - taxaplease: path to taxaplease database. If not provided, a new database will be created for each sample.

        Outputs:
            - 3 upload_files_* channels: for viral aligner, kraken-bacteria (this is a tuple of two files) and sylph results files to be uploaded to S3.
            - 3 analysis_json_* channels for viral_aligner, kraken-bacteria and sylph analyses to be added to Onyx.
